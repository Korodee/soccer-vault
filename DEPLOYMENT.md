     -e STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_key \
     -e STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_key \
     soccer-vault
   ```

## üîß Post-Deployment

### 1. Test Payment Flow
- Use Stripe test cards to verify checkout works
- Test both success and failure scenarios

### 2. Verify Images
- Check that product images load correctly
- If using Cloudinary, verify uploads work

### 3. Monitor Performance
- Check Core Web Vitals in Google PageSpeed Insights
- Monitor error rates in your hosting platform

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Check TypeScript errors: `npm run lint`
- Verify environment variables are set

### Image Issues
- If images don't load, check file paths in `products.ts`
- Consider using Cloudinary for better performance
- Verify image files exist in `public/images/`

### Payment Issues
- Verify Stripe keys are correct
- Check Stripe webhook configuration
- Test with Stripe's test mode first

### Performance Issues
- Enable image optimization in Next.js
- Consider using Cloudinary for image hosting
- Implement proper caching headers

## üìä Analytics & Monitoring

### Recommended Tools
- **Vercel Analytics** (if using Vercel)
- **Google Analytics** for user behavior
- **Stripe Dashboard** for payment analytics
- **Sentry** for error monitoring

### Setup
1. Add analytics tracking codes to `src/app/layout.tsx`
2. Configure error monitoring
3. Set up payment webhooks for real-time data

## üîí Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- Use platform-specific secret management
- Rotate API keys regularly

### Payment Security
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Verify Stripe webhook signatures
- Implement proper error handling

### Image Security
- Validate image uploads (if implementing)
- Use proper CORS headers
- Consider image optimization

## üìà Scaling Considerations

### Performance
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use CDN for static assets
- Consider database for large product catalogs

### Infrastructure
- Monitor resource usage
- Set up auto-scaling if needed
- Implement proper logging
